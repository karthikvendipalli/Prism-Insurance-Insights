 # Key Insights:
## Premium and Claim Overview:
Total Premium Amount: $5.98M
Total Coverage Amount: $600.55M
Total Claim Amount: $16.91M
The premium collected is relatively low compared to the total coverage amount, indicating a need for premium price adjustments or policy restructuring.
Policy Performance:

## Premium by Policy Type:
Travel insurance generates the highest premium revenue, followed by Health, Auto, Life, and Home.
Auto and Home insurance seem to generate lower premiums, possibly due to fewer policies or lower pricing.
Active vs. Inactive Policies:

## Claims by Status:
Rejected: 4.4K claims
Settled: 3.4K claims
Pending: 2.3K claims
A significant number of claims are rejected, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and negative brand perception.
A relatively high pending claim amount indicates possible inefficiencies in claims processing.

# Recommendations for Improvement:

## Increase Policy Renewals & Customer Engagement:
With over 52% inactive policies, implementing loyalty programs, reminders, and incentives for renewals can boost active policies.
Improve Claims Processing Efficiency:

Reduce the number of pending claims, especially in Home and Health insurance, to enhance customer satisfaction.
Analyze rejection reasons and improve claim approval processes.
Re-evaluate Premium Pricing:

With coverage amounts significantly higher than premium amounts, adjusting premium rates based on risk factors might be beneficial.
Enhance Product Focus:

Since Travel insurance generates the highest premium, it may be worthwhile to explore bundling with other products for better sales.
